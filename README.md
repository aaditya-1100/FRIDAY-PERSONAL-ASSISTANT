## The idea

Most AI interfaces stop at generating an answer.

ATOM explores the next layer: **how an AI system can move from understanding an instruction to operating inside a real environment.**

The system is built around a continuous control loop:

**Perceive → Interpret → Plan → Delegate → Execute → Synthesize → Reflect**

A language model provides reasoning capability, but ATOM is the surrounding system that gives that reasoning access to a computer.

## Interaction model

ATOM is designed to stay **out of the way of the user's work**.

It appears as a narrow, pill-shaped **floating island at the top-center of the screen**, directly beneath the camera/notch area on a modern laptop. It acts as a compact status and interaction surface rather than demanding focus.

### Push-to-talk, by design

ATOM uses a deliberate **walkie-talkie interaction model**:

**Hold `Ctrl + Alt + Z` → speak → release → ATOM processes the turn.**

The microphone is only active while the hotkey is held. There is no passive background listening in the normal interaction flow.

This design gives the user explicit control over microphone activation and avoids treating connectivity or application startup as permission to listen.

### What happens during a turn

When the hotkey is held, the floating island indicates that ATOM is actively listening. When the key is released, the system moves through its processing stages and returns to idle after responding.

The interaction pipeline is:

1. **Listen** — capture the user's voice while push-to-talk is held.
2. **Transcribe** — process speech locally with Faster-Whisper.
3. **Interpret** — determine whether the request is a question, command, memory lookup, or system action.
4. **Plan / route** — use deterministic routing where appropriate and LLM-assisted reasoning where ambiguity requires it.
5. **Execute** — delegate work to the relevant agent and tools.
6. **Respond** — synthesize the result and speak it back with Edge-TTS.
7. **Reflect / remember** — update relevant interaction state and memory.

The UI is intentionally minimal: no modal workflow, no full-screen takeover, and no requirement to leave the application currently in use.

## What ATOM can do from that interface

From a single deliberate push-to-talk interaction, ATOM can:

- answer questions using live web retrieval or stored context
- capture and analyze screenshots
- read and locate text on the current screen
- open applications and interact with Windows resources
- work with files and system information through guarded tool paths
- retrieve relevant information from semantic and episodic memory
- surface passive/proactive information through the floating island without turning every event into a spoken interruption

ATOM is designed around the idea that **the computer itself is part of the environment the agent observes and acts within**.

## What ATOM actually is

ATOM is not designed as a single monolithic chatbot. It is a small **agent runtime** with explicit state, asynchronous event routing, specialized agents, tool permissions, and memory services.

At the center is a cognitive state machine with explicit transitions such as:

```text
IDLE
  ↓
PERCEIVING
  ↓
PLANNING
  ↓
DELEGATING
  ↓
WAITING
  ↓
SYNTHESIZING
  ↓
RESPONDING
  ↓
REFLECTING
  ↓
IDLE
```

Interruptions and failures are modeled explicitly rather than treated as ordinary responses.

## The important engineering pieces

### 1. Cognitive state and control flow

ATOM uses an explicit state machine instead of a single request/response function. Each transition is validated, logged, associated with a correlation ID, and published through the event system.

This gives the system a concrete representation of **where an interaction is, what it is doing, and how it can recover or be interrupted**.

### 2. Event-driven orchestration

Agents communicate through a priority-aware asynchronous event bus. Events carry session IDs, correlation IDs, sources, priorities, and structured payloads.

The bus supports wildcard subscriptions and concurrent delivery, allowing the cognitive layer and specialized agents to remain decoupled.

### 3. Specialized agents

ATOM currently separates responsibilities into seven agents:

- **PC** — Windows, applications, files, system operations
- **Web** — browser interaction and web workflows
- **Media** — media and playback control
- **Vision** — screenshot reading, OCR, screen description, screen targeting
- **Memory** — storing and retrieving contextual information
- **Knowledge** — knowledge-oriented tasks and retrieval
- **Voice** — speech input/output lifecycle

Each agent follows a common lifecycle, declares capabilities, processes dispatched tasks, reports structured results, and emits health/heartbeat events.

### 4. Perception and computer vision

ATOM can capture the current screen and turn it into machine-usable context.

Its vision layer supports operations such as:

- structured screen reading
- OCR-based text extraction
- finding text on screen
- screen description
- screenshot capture
- visual understanding
- locating UI targets for computer interaction

This makes the computer an environment ATOM can **observe**, not merely a set of APIs it can call.

### 5. Persistent memory

ATOM's memory is more than conversation history.

The architecture combines working/session context with semantic and episodic retrieval. Semantic memory uses embeddings with local Qdrant storage, while the cognitive layer can retrieve relevant memory under a latency budget before planning a response or action.

The practical goal is simple: **do not force every interaction to start from zero.**

### 6. Safety and authorization

Giving an AI access to a computer requires more than tool availability.

ATOM includes agent trust levels and a permission engine that maps tools to permission requirements. Sensitive operations can trigger a human-confirmation flow, while denied operations are audit-logged rather than silently executed.

The intended model is:

**Capability ≠ unrestricted authority.**

### 7. Stateful context

The cognitive layer assembles context from multiple sources when needed:

- current system state
- active application/window
- screen context
- tool results
- semantic memory
- recent episodic context
- recent conversation turns

This context is then supplied to the reasoning layer with explicit budget management and truncation rules.

## Why the interface is deliberately minimal

ATOM is designed to sit **alongside work, not on top of it**.

The floating island occupies a small strip of otherwise unused screen space. Push-to-talk makes activation explicit. Voice input and voice output keep the user's hands available for whatever they are already doing.

The design goal is not to make the assistant the center of attention. It is to make AI capability **immediately available without demanding focus**.

## Reliability engineering

ATOM has gone through multiple iterations focused less on adding features and more on making the runtime behave predictably.

Recent work includes:

- fixing ambient self-listening and microphone-state synchronization
- hardening hold-to-talk speech recognition
- removing startup-time microphone activation
- reducing startup latency
- stabilizing asynchronous task cancellation
- moving semantic embeddings to the lighter fastembed / ONNX stack
- removing local databases and release artifacts from the public repository
- maintaining regression, health, routing, and determinism checks

## Performance snapshot

The repository's documented lean-build measurements report:

| Metric | Measurement |
|---|---:|
| Boot import time | ~2.0 s |
| RAM at idle boot | ~140 MB |
| RAM after first query | ~325 MB |
| Regression suite | Development measurement |

These are development measurements from the project, not independent benchmarks or production guarantees.

## Project status

**Stable beta / experimental public release.**

ATOM is intentionally a systems project exploring the engineering problems around agentic computer interaction: control flow, tool orchestration, perception, memory, permissions, latency, reliability, and recovery.

## What I am exploring

The central question behind the project is:

> **What software architecture is needed for an AI system to reliably act in a real computer environment rather than only generate text?**

That question naturally connects ATOM to broader areas of AI engineering:

- agentic systems
- human-computer interaction
- multimodal perception
- computer use
- memory architectures
- tool-using language models
- autonomous robotics and embodied AI
